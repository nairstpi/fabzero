### Mentors
#### Sh. Francisco Sanchez
It is our luck to have a cool mentor like Sh. Francisco Sanchez, who is quite knowledgeable and at the same time, listens to everyone in sorting out their issues.

#### Sh. Sibu Saman
An ex-fablab Kerala employee is Sh. Sibu Saman and now working with Fablab foundation is the other mentor for our training program. I am happy that I can speak to him in malayalam, the language common to both of us.
