He had taken us through the journey in setting-up of the Fablab in STPI-Bhubaneswar. The training program (Fabzero) was launched by **Dr. Omkar Rai**, Director General, STPI, followed with his inaugural address emphasizing the need and importance of Fablab across STPI, also urged each Directorates to set-up at least one such lab after ensuring the financial assistance from respective State Governments.

Sh. Manas Panda, Director, STPI, Bhubaneswar introduced the mentors and Sh. Francisco shared his views about the Fabzero training program and the expectations out of the training.

Post a short break, the actual session kick started. Sh. Francisco explained about the insights of this training and taken us through the various initial iterations of the training program in the past. Happy to know that the first two iterations were held in Kerala, India, followed by the third one in Jordan in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. 

He explained about how to take note of the important things, arising out of the deliberations/interactions in the classroom and predominantly in the Fablab. 

### Fablab tour

Mentor Sh. Sibu introduced and explained all the equipments in our Fablab. The gathered details are stated below. 

**Shopbot Alpha** - 3 Axis milling machine, 96"/48", subtractive model with resolution of 1/10th mm. Ideal for wooden materials and other soft metals like Aluminium, Brass, etc.         
**Band Saw** - 3966         
**Scroll Saw**     
**High Pressure Cleaning Unit**      

**Shopbot Mini** - 3 Axis milling machine, ideal for making small jobs.      
**Vinyl Cutter** - Can be used as plotter too. Though it is a 2 axis machine, it can even work as more than 2 axis machine, perhaps up to 2.5.

**Laser Cutter** - CO2 type, 3 axis machine with the wavelength of 10.2 micrometer. Absorbing type materials can be used in this machine. It also has a 3 stage filtration system, which filters out hard dust, fine dust and gases in stages.        
**3D Printer** - Additive type, Fused _Filament_ Deposition. Same material for sacrificing material.    
**3D Printer** - Liquid resin gets solidified by exposure to UV rays. Stereo Lithography. Same sacrificing material.       
**3D Printer** - Inkjet based type. Different material can be used as sacrificing material.

We could also notice electronics lab equipments like Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Power Supply, etc. Further the consumable rack is also seen in the lab, Sh. Francisco stressed upon the need to rearrange everything in order, after our assignment.

###  Documentation Tips & Insight of Academany

Learnt that either Linux distribution is needed for Fablab training or either the VM instances. And hardly none has Linux installed Laptops in the class and so it is agreed to work with virtual machines. All participants were asked to create a username in github portal and I created as nairstpi. Then under repository tab, a public repository is created with name as fabzero, wherein we need to put our daily works and activities, documented.

Mentor insists all of us to take note of all the happenings in the training in the notepad, systematically date-wise. Further it is required to be typed in a text editor and everyone was asked to download and use the Visual Studio Code and save the file as "README.md". 

Academany- The Academy of Almost Anything offers high level education across globe, directed by people leading the way in their field, constantly evolve to stay at the cutting edge development of research into tools, techniques and technologies.

Academany programs are distributed learning system with mentors rather teachers, inline with the nine principles of Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab).
