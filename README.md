# Documentation of my experiences in Fab Zero, held at the ELITE facility of STPI, Bhubaneswar, India.

## `Introduction`
Profound thanks to the Almighty for the opportunity and the coincidental choice of the management to nominate me for the training, I am happy to be part of the STPI team, selected for the Fab Zero training for a duration of 3 weeks scheduled from 18th March to 5th April 2019. Here I will be documenting all my experiences, evolved out of the learning processes during these days for my future benefit, rather than for the mentor to evaluate me.
