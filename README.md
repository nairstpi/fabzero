## [Day 1](day1.md)


## Day 2 : 19 March 2019, Tuesday, 10:00 to 18:15 hrs IST.   

### Morning Session
Sh. Francisco Sanchez started verifying the text document made by each individual, as a teacher rather mentor.   

Copied the text file contents to the portal README.md file, followed with a key stroke in the commit button, with a proper and meaningful commit message commensurating with the activity being performed each time. Repeated with editing the text file and copying to README.md and committing each time for changes. Felt happy to see the uploaded contents on the portal.     

Mentor signalled to stop repeated editions and uploading contents to portal and to use little automated process. Open a new window in Visual Studio Code and hit Ctrl+Shift+P key strokes and type git:clone. Alas!, it didn't work due to Windows lacking to support git. Downloaded and installed Git for Windows from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Now it is required to restart the Visual Studio Code for the git changes to effect.       

Open Visual Studio Code and type Ctrl+Shift+P and enter git:clone and feed in the repository link, obtained from the Clone or download option in the [github page](https://github.com/nairstpi/fabzero). Folder needs to be selected for the repository to clone. In my case, it is Desktop/Fablab.      

Now the task of uploading becomes quite easy that from the Visual Studio Code, we can open the README.md file and commit the changes with message and push it to the web.  Hurray! Big task made simple...:)
