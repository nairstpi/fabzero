Vinyl cutter is a type of computer controlled machine. Though it is a 2 axis machine, it can even work as more than 2 axis machine, perhaps up to 2.5 axis. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl). They cut shapes in adhesive vinyl, which can be stuck onto almost any surface.  

On the very second day, Sh. Francisco demonstrated to load vinyl sheet into the cutter. He unloaded the lever behind the printer and inserted the vinyl sheet. The sheet while loading should be aligned to grooves. The sheet when placed on the machine has to be between any two white markings seen in the front. Load the cutting blade to the printer.

The printer has an instrument cluster as shown. 


Select the type of vinyl used for printing whether it is a sheet, piece or roll. to the machine and the keys are used for navigating the cutting head . Using the navigation button move the head towards the point from where the cut has to begin. He moved it accordingly and pressed the origin button. Now the machine considers this as the origin. Now he pressed the test button. This performed a test cut in the vinyl. A square within a circle. The objective of this test is that the user should be able to peel of the circle without removing the square. This ensures that the blades are sharp enough and the applied pen force is sufficient. 


The first assignment given to us is to create a sticker using the vinyl cutter.

 started todayâ€™s class by giving an introduction to vinyl cutting. The first step was to connect my laptop with the printer. Fab academy do not recommend using drivers for printing instead use fab modules. So for connecting the printer with my PC log on to http://localhost:631 . This led me to a website named CUPS (C UNIX Printing Systems).
