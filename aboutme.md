I am pretty good at networking which I had taught my own and later certified for CCNA & CCNP (Composite Routing & Switching) well before 2005. Gained sound knowledge in ISP operations, satellite earth station equipment, terrestrial microwave links, etc. Subsequently gained expertise in the implementation of physical infrastructure of Datacenter. Highly confident in taking training session for all areas in which I gained sufficient expertise. Had a short span of opportunity to work with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and _80x1_ micro-controllers. From the programming skills, I can write codes in C, C++ and slightly in Java too. Other than the legacy OS, I have tried various distributions of Linux viz Redhat, Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, etc.
